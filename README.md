## Description 
Traceroute is a utility that records the route (specific gateway computers at each hop) through the internet between your computer and a specified destination computer. <br>

While it's interesting to see how many hops a packet takes and its location, it is difficult to see, in a visual sense, where the packets are hopping. <br>

The purpose of this project is to generate a nice visualization of how indirect packet routes can. This visualization will then be further analyzed in terms of packet locations and RTT.  <br>
