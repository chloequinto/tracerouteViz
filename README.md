## Description 
Traceroute is a utility that records the route (specific gateway computers at each hop) through the internet between your cmoputer and a specified destination computer. <br>

While it's interesting to see how many hops a packet takes and its location, it is difficult to see, in a visual sense, where the packets are hopping. <br>

This purpose of this project is to give a nice visualization of how indirect packet routes can be. <br>
